# Notes on Vaclav Smil, _Energy_

> 	It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy _is_. We do not have a picture that energy comes in little blobs of a definite amount. it is not that way. However, there are formulas for calculating some numerical quantity... It is an abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanism or the _reasons_ for the various formulas.
	â€“ Richard Feynman, _Lectures on Physics_, (1963), quoted from Vaclav Smil, _Energy_ (loc 180/3234)

Energy is an abstract thing, only knowable through formula, through it's properties. It is a concept that we apply to the transformation of things. It is fundamental, yet invisible, completely conceptual. 

It is also permiscuous. As a result, abusing energy is easy.
