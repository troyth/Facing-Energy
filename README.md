>	“We do not have an energy crisis, we have a crisis of ignorance.”
	–Buckminster Fuller

The greatest issues we face at a global scale are fundamentally energy issues, yet energy does not have a face. Energy is anonymous. It doesn't come with metadata, a serial number, or a signature. There is no distinction, or means of distinguishing, between good and bad energy. Our interfaces with energy are simple and opaque - holes in walls or at the end of tubes - they belie the complexity of the social-political-economic-environmental apparatus that underpins energy sourcing, processing and distribution. The success story of modernization – the ability to plug-in, switch-on, or fill-up without reflection – is rendered an incapacitation in the light of contemporary concerns over global warming and climate change. As our sites of registration of energy use are abstracted and muted, our capacity to regulate and condition behavior is nulled.

Most culpable in this crime of identity theft is architecture. Through the migration of heating, ventilation, lighting and other climatic conditioning functions of architecture into mechanical and electrical solutions buried in raised floors and drop ceilings, wet walls and air plena, camouflaged mechanical storeys and ever thinner building envelopes, modernization has tuned architecture into an efficient machine for consuming energy under the radar of human sensibility. Or more precisely, the most efficient, as architecture accounts for more than half of global energy consumption. It is thus the greatest lever through which to affect energy, yet this possibility is surrendered so long as it remains a black box.

In order to address this seemingly intractable problem, we will approach it as a design problem focused on the _interface_ as both object and concept. Funded by the GSAPP Future of Energy initiative, students will work in small groups to define, design, develop, deploy and test an _architectural energy interface_ with a budget to manage and dispense.

Each group will develop a position on the topic of energy and a strategy that will lead to a corresponding interpretation of the interface. Whether a poster, book, installation, app, film, appliance, campaign, service, blog or symposium, the objective will be to define, measure and create impact. That is, to actually enter the live debate, assemble an audience – whether a limited group of “influencers”, the media, or a massive global community – and produce measureable effects.

To support this ambition, the pedagogy will accordingly be dual: part history/theory seminar to identify and develop a position on the landscape of the contemporary energy discourse and situate it in a historical context, and part product design workshop. We will pair traditional discursive methods with contemporary approaches culled from practices of entrepreneurship, technology, design, communication and creative and innovation consulting, including brainstorms and workshops led by guests from companies such as Google, IDEO, Nike and Kickstarter. We will simultaneously build a common inventory of discursive tools - by investigating a series of objects: power, disruption, crisis, environment, climate, risk, lifestyle, landscape and development - and methodological and strategic tools for each team to leverage in producing an interface.

Graduating students of the seminar may also be eligible for a funded position in the forthcoming GSAPP space in the art-design-technology incubator at the New Museum as part of the Future of Energy initiative.
